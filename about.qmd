I'm a data scientist, writer, educator & podcaster. My interests include promoting data & AI literacy/fluency, helping to spread data skills through organizations and society and lowering the barrier to entry for data science, analysis, and machine learning. I'm currently Head of Developer Relations at [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com/), a company committed to building infrastructure that provides a solid foundation for machine learning and AI applications of all shapes and sizes. I am also the host of the industry podcast [Vanishing Gradients](https://vanishinggradients.fireside.fm/). Find out more [here](https://hugobowne.github.io/).
